# Product-Analysis-

The goal is to analyze which products were resulting in converting first time buyers into repeat-buyers, that is, finding out purchases that led to a positive customer experience. This analysis would help the marketers determine which products are to be merchandised to the new customers so that they come again for their next purchase. I've filtered out one-time buyers, whose purchasing frequency was less than 2. 

Attributes required:
